# Enterprise Security Automation with Ansible

**Final Project (Case Study)**  

This repository contains the final project for **CPE 213-CPE32S21 - Cloud Management and Security**. It demonstrates a **simulated enterprise security solution** for a hybrid IT infrastructure using **Ansible automation**.

**Project Objectives**
- Automate Linux server security configurations.
- Implement firewall rules, service hardening, and access control policies.
- Streamline network and endpoint security for consistent enforcement.

**Simulation Environment**
- VirtualBox with Ubuntu Server nodes.
- One node as Ansible control, others as managed hosts.
- Automated tasks include firewall setup, user access control, login banners, and system hardening.

**Key Skills Demonstrated**
Ansible, Linux Security, Firewall Management, Endpoint Hardening, Automation, Hybrid Cloud Security

**Reflections**
This project highlights how **security automation** improves consistency, reduces errors, and strengthens an organizationâ€™s security posture. Using Ansible to automate firewall and access policies provides hands-on experience in **enterprise security management**.
