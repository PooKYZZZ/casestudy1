# Enterprise Security Automation with Ansible

**Project Overview**  
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an **enterprise security solution** for a hybrid IT infrastructure using **Ansible automation**. The simulated company, SmartRetail Systems Corp., operates in the retail technology and e-commerce space, combining on-premises and cloud resources.

**Objectives**
- Automate baseline security configurations across Linux servers.
- Implement firewall rules, service hardening, and access control policies.
- Streamline network segmentation and endpoint protection processes.
- Improve consistency, reduce human error, and enhance overall security posture.

**Key Components**
- **Network Security:** VLAN segmentation, firewall rules with UFW and rate-limited SSH.
- **Endpoint Security:** SentinelOne EDR simulation, OS hardening, and patch management.
- **IAM & Access Control:** Login banners, messages of the day (MOTD), secure user configuration.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Centralized logging concepts and anomaly alerting.
- **Automation:** Ansible playbooks and roles to manage security consistently.

**Simulation Setup**
- Virtualized environment using VirtualBox with Ubuntu Server nodes.
- One node as Ansible control, others as managed hosts.
- Tasks automated include firewall installation/configuration, disabling guest login, and basic system hardening.

**Key Skills**
Ansible, Linux Security, Firewall Management, Endpoint Security, Automation, Hybrid Cloud Concepts

**Reflections**
Automation with Ansible enables consistent enforcement of security policies across multiple servers. By integrating network segmentation, endpoint protection, and logging practices, organizations can reduce risk, improve response times, and maintain regulatory compliance. This project strengthened my skills in **security automation**, **hybrid IT security design**, and **practical Ansible implementation**.
